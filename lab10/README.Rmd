TIP: Use can use the following QUERY to see the structure of a table

```{sql, connection=con}
PRAGMA table_info(actor)
```

SQL references:

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/

# Exercise 1

Retrive the actor ID, first name and last name for all actors using the `actor` table. Sort by last name and then by first name.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
ORDER by last_name, first_name
```

# Exercise 2

Retrive the actor ID, first name, and last name for actors whose last name equals 'WILLIAMS' or 'DAVIS'.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS', 'DAVIS')
```

# Exercise 3

Write a query against the `rental` table that returns the IDs of the customers who rented a film on July 5, 2005 (use the rental.rental_date column, and you can use the date() function to ignore the time component). Include a single row for each distinct customer ID. 

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id 
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
```
# Exercise 4

## Exercise 4.1

Construct a query that retrives all rows from the `payment` table where the amount is either 1.99, 7.99, 9.99.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (1.99, 7.99, 9.99)
```

## Exercise 4.2

Construct a query that retrives all rows from the `payment` table where the amount is greater then 5

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount>5
```

## Exercise 4.2

Construct a query that retrives all rows from the `payment` table where the amount is greater then 5 and less then 8

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount>5 AND amount<8
```
# Exercise 5

Retrive all the payment IDs and their amount from the customers whose last name is 'DAVIS'.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT t1.payment_id,t1.amount
FROM payment AS t1
  INNER JOIN customer as t2 ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id
WHERE t2.last_name="DAVIS"

```

# Exercise 6

## Exercise 6.1

Use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of rows in `rental`

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM rental
```

## Exercise 6.2

Use `COUNT(*)` and `GROUP BY` to count the number of rentals for each `customer_id`

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_rentals, customer_id
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
```
## Exercise 6.3

Repeat the previous query and sort by the count in descending order

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rentals, customer_id
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY num_rentals DESC
```

## Exercise 6.4

Repeat the previous query but use `HAVING` to only keep the groups with 40 or more.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rentals, customer_id
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING num_rentals >= 40
ORDER BY num_rentals DESC

```

# Exercise 7

The following query calculates a number of summary statistics for the payment table using `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG` and `SUM`

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT MAX(amount) as max,
       MIN(amount) as min,
       AVG(amount) as avg,
       SUM(amount) as sum
FROM payment
       
```

## Exercise 7.1

Modify the above query to do those calculations for each `customer_id`

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT MAX(amount) as max,
       MIN(amount) as min,
       AVG(amount) as avg,
       SUM(amount) as sum,
       customer_id
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
```
## Exercise 7.2

Modify the above query to only keep the `customer_id`s that have more then 5 payments

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT MAX(amount) as max,
       MIN(amount) as min,
       AVG(amount) as avg,
       SUM(amount) as sum,
       COUNT(*) as count,
       customer_id
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>5
```
# Cleanup

Run the following chunk to disconnect from the connection.

```{r}
# clean up
dbDisconnect(con)
```
